# School District Analysis

## Overview
A School District Board recieved an initial analysis of some data they provided.  After reviewing the data they asked to see the analysis without the math and reading grades for the Thomas High School 9th graders.  There was some concern that the information provided in the student data for those students had been altered.  The purpose of this analysis is to see if the findings show any discrepencies.

In the initial analysis the School Board provided the analyst with school and student data for the district.  The school data had the following columns:<br>
__School ID, School Name, Type (of school), Size and Budget.__

The student data consisted of these columns:<br>
__Student ID, Student Name, Gender, Grade, School Name, Reading Score and Math Score__

The initial analysis gathered together information about the schools and students into these summaries:<br>
__District Summary, Per School Summary, Per School Capita, Spending Summary, Summary based on School Size, Summary based on type of School, Top Schools and Bottom Schools, Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade__

## Setup for Analysis
This analysis will show through comparision how the initial analysis and the analysis without Thomas High School 9th graders vary.  Here in the output below you can see that the Thomas High School 9th Graders have had their grades removed from analysis by replacing their grades with NaN (Not a number). (Red lines added for emphasis.)
